# Palindrome-Checker
A palindrome is a word or sentence that's spelled the same way both forward and backward, ignoring punctuation, case, and spacing.

# Lessons Learned
* Removing all non-alphanumeric characters (punctuation, spaces and symbols) using String functions and Regex.
* Turning everything into the same case (lower or upper case) in order to check for palindromes using String functions and Regex.
